# Spherrrical.dev

Spherrrical.dev is a personal website and blog built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MDX. I also used many TailwindUI components for which I purchased.

Check out the tools I used:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - the official Tailwind CSS documentation
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) - the official Next.js documentation
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev) - the official Headless UI documentation
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) - the MDX documentation
